# 🛰️ Kafnus

**Kafnus** is a smart city data persistence system, designed as a modern replacement for Cygnus, built on top of **Kafka**.

It processes NGSI notifications from the Context Broker (CB) and stores them in **PostGIS** and **MongoDB**, leveraging technologies like **Faust**, **Kafka Connect**, and custom connectors.

---

## 📦 Main Components

- 🏢 **Context Broker (CB)**  
  The origin of NGSI notifications. It sends entity updates and context data to Kafka, where Kafnus NGSI listens and processes the incoming information.

- ⚙️ **Kafnus NGSI**  
  Node.js service that transforms raw notifications into structured events. Each data flow (historic, lastdata, mutable, etc.) is handled by an independent agent.

- 🔄 **Kafnus Connect**  
  Custom image of Kafka Connect with plugins integrated. Persists processed messages to:
  - **PostGIS**, via a modified JDBC connector and custom SMT.
  - **MongoDB**, via the official MongoDB connector.

- 📊 **Monitoring**  
  Integrated with Prometheus and Grafana to expose metrics from Kafka, Kafnus Connect, and Kafnus NGSI.

- 🧪 **End-to-End Testing**  
  Functional tests implemented in Python using Pytest and Testcontainers.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Replace Cygnus in FIWARE smart city stacks.
- Provide robust, extensible ingestion with real-time stream processing.
- Offer a Kafka-based architecture ready for future scalability.
