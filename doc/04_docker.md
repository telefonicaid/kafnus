# üê≥ Docker Setup

This document describes the Docker-based environment used in Kafnus, including the `docker-compose` files, build configuration for custom images, and helper scripts.

---

## üìÅ File Structure

Most of Docker-related files are located in the `docker/` directory:

```plaintext
docker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.kafka.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.faust.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.orion.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.postgis.yml     # (optional, disabled by default)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.monitoring.yml  # (optional, disabled by default)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-up.sh
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-down.sh
```

Custom Dockerfiles are located in their respective component directories:

```plaintext
kafka-connect-custom/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile

kafka-ngsi-stream/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Starting and Stopping Services

### `docker-up.sh`

Starts the default stack, including:

- Kafka + Kafka Connect
- Faust
- Orion + Mongo + Mosquitto

PostGIS and Monitoring are commented out by default.

```bash
./docker-up.sh
```

### `docker-down.sh`

Stops the same services and removes volumes & orphan containers:

```bash
./docker-down.sh
```

> You can pass arguments like `-d` to run in detached mode (`--build` argument it is present by default).

## üß± Compose Files Summary

### `docker-compose.kafka.yml`

Defines:

- Kafka broker (port 9092, 29092)
- Kafka Connect custom image with plugins:
  - Builds and runs custom image
  - Custom plugins in `/usr/local/share/kafka-connect/plugins`
  - Monitoring enabled via JMX Exporter
- Connect waits for Kafka to be healthy before starting

Topics are auto-created (`KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE=true`)

Kafka Connect image is built from the [`Dockerfile`](../kafka-connect-custom/Dockerfile).

Exposes:
- Port `8083`: Kafka Connect API
- Port `9100`: Prometheus metrics

To build from `/kafka-connect-custom` directory you can use:

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t kafnus-connect .
```

---

### `docker-compose.faust.yml`

Defines:

- `create-topics`: Creates all Kafka topics needed by Faust and Connect
- `faust-stream`: Builds and runs the Faust service

Faust image is built from the [`Dockerfile`](../kafka-ngsi-stream/Dockerfile).

Exposes:
- Port `8000`: Prometheus metrics
- Port `6066`: Optional Faust web interface (disabled by default)

To build from `/kafka-ngsi-stream` directory you can use:

```bash
docker build --no-cache -t faust-stream .
```

---

### `docker-compose.orion.yml`

Defines:

- **Orion Context Broker**
- **MongoDB**
- **Mosquitto**

Orion is configured to use Mosquitto as MQTT broker and MongoDB as DB backend. The broker reads config via `command: -dbURI`.

---

### `docker-compose.postgis.yml`

Defines the PostGIS database:

- Image: `telefonicaiot/iotp-postgis`
- Mounts volume: `${DBPATH_POSTGIS}` (bind mount must be defined in your shell). **IMPORTANT**: that directory has to have the right owner/permissions or the PostGIS container will refuse to start (typically `sudo chown -R 999:999 ${DBPATH_POSTGIS}`, as 999 is the usual UID and GID for PostGIS user).
- Exposes port `5432`

You can activate this in `docker-up.sh` by uncommenting the corresponding line.

---

### `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` (optional)

Includes:

- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Kafka Exporter
- Faust/Metrics Exporter

Disabled by default. You can enable it by uncommenting in `docker-up.sh`.

---

## üîó Shared Network

All services connect to the external Docker network:

```yaml
networks:
  kafka-postgis-net:
    external: true
```

Make sure this network exists (e.g. using `docker network ls`) otherwise create it using:

```bash
docker network create kafka-postgis-net
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Plugins

Kafka Connect copy plugins from:

- `kafka-connect-custom/plugins/`: contains:
  - `header-router` (custom SMT)
  - `kafka-connect-jdbc` (custom connector with geometry support)
  - `mongodb` connector
  - `mqtt-kafka-connect` temporal bridge between CB and Kafka

Plugins are referenced by `CONNECT_PLUGIN_PATH`.

---

## üß™ Notes for Testing

The test suite can also dynamically start these containers via **Testcontainers** when running end-to-end tests. See `doc/08_testing.md`.
